# Light and Temperature sensor for domotica
LM335 and BMP280 temperature sensor in combination with a lightsensor based on arduino to control the blinds and heating.
Values shown on a 128x64 OLED display and in the Serial monitor.
If the temperature drops below 21°C the heating turns on. If the temperature is higher then 21°C there is no heating.
If it gets dark the blinds go down and when it gets light again they go up.
